# Learn To Node

For one to Run The Numbers they have to Run A Node. As it becomes easier and easier to run a Bitcoin node with every User Experience improvement that abstracts away from the complexity more and more people find themselves [Running Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/halfin/status/1110302988). But User Experience tends to do very little on the side of User Education.

The decentralization of Bitcoin not only depends on people running nodes to verify that the consensus protocol is followed by each transaction in each block but it also requires people to understand how their node operates and how their nodes enforce the consensus rules. 

Learn To Node is a site aiming educate users on what is happening when 1 is running a node. It aims to make a collection of resources for the steps one would take when installing and running a node participating in the Bitcoin network. 

The magnum opus of the project will be in **explaining the contents of the debug log**. And what a person should learn from the output they would see in their debug logs. For the purpose of not only debugging their operation of a node but to also understand how the log lines relate to the Bitcoin protocol (where possible to explain the protocol).

This focus on elaborating the contents nodes produce in their debug logs aims to not only add value to beginners but to also help educate people who had already had the technical skill to run a node but liked the technical skill to dive into the codebase and understand the Bitcoin protocol better by explaining what the log items actually mean in detail.

If the Bitcoin ecosystem was the world of Pokemon, Learn To Node would be the Pokedox trainers walk around with trying to *stack* them all.
